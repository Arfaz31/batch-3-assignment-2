### To run my code locally, someone would typically follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository: They would clone the repository containing your code to their local machine using Git. They can do this by running the following command in their terminal or command prompt: git clone <repository-url>

2. Install Dependencies: Once they have cloned the repository, they would navigate to the project directory on their local machine and install any dependencies required by your application. They can do this by running:cd <project-directory>
   npm install

3.Start the Application: ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only src/server.ts

4. Access the Application: Once the application is running, they can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to the URL where the application is hosted locally. They can interact with the application just as they would with any other web application.
